# tabstack README

A simple VS Code extension that stores/restores open tab arrangements. This is useful when switching between multiple tasks in a single workspace.

## Features

This extension can:

- Save the current arrangement of open tabs as a named "tab stack"
- Load a previously saved tab stack to restore that arrangement
- Delete saved tab stacks when they are no longer needed
